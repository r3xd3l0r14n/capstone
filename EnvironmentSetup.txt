This is a real informal guide to some needed / recommended programs
that I'm using for developing.

Needed:
Python 3.5.2 or higher (use the pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies)
gcloud sdk (Only if you plan on sshing into the vm or are on linux)
Access to Bitbucket
Access to Google Cloud Platform
Access to Jira Software Cloud
Git or Atlassian SourceTree (either one, I prefer the Git CLI just because thats what I learned first
        but SourceTree also works really well)

Recommended:
PyCharm (The only reason I recommend this is because it has VCS built right in
and it manages a lot of pythonisms directly for you)
